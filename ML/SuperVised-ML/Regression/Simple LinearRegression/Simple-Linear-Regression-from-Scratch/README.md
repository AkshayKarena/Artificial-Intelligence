# Simple Linear Regression from Scrtch
This Repositry demonstrates the Regression From Scratch without using any macine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn(sklearn). The Dataset used in this project is Synthetically generated to clearly understand the working of the Algorithm.

# Project Overview
Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental of supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between features(input) variable and target(output) variable.
This project focuses on:-
- Understanding the mathematical foundation of linear regression
- Implementing the algorithm step-by-step using python
- Traing the model using Synthetic data
- visualizing the regression line
