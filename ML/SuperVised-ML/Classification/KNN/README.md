# KNN Classification Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python and Scikit-learn.
The goal of this project is to build a classification model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

# Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
  A supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification based on feature similarity.

# Project Flow
1. Data Loading
2. Check Missing Values and Get Overview of Data
3. Data Visualization
4. Plot Heatmap for check Features Relations
5. Label Encodeing
6. Split Data into Traing Data and  Testing Data
7. Model Traning using KNN
8. Make Prediction on testing Data
9. Model Evaluation
    -Accuracy Score
    -Classification Report
    -Confusion Matrix
10. Find Best K for the Model

# Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matlpotlib
- seanborn
- Scikit-learn(sklearn)

# Detailed Used
- pandas - Data manipulation and Analysis
- numpy - Numerical computations
- matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
- sklearn.model_selection – Train-test split
- sklearn.preprocessing – Label Encoding & Standard Scaling
- sklearn.neighbors – KNeighborsClassifier
- sklearn.metrics – Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

# Note
In this project  Dataset which i used is generated by ChatGPT. And this data set is small that's why it's accuracy is high when you give K=5 accuracy become 1, it means perfect model which not possible in real life it shows overffiting.
