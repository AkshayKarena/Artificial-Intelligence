# Decision Tree Regressor
This project implement a Decision Tree Regressor using a dataset that containts categorical features. This project covers data visualization, data encoding model traing and testing, and find means quared error, and R2 Score.

# Steps performed in this project
1. Dataset visualization
   - Loaded the dataset using Pandas
   - Visualized the data to understand patterns and distributions
   - Plotted a heatmap to analyze correlations between numerical features
2. Data Perpocessing
   - Handled categorical features using One-Hot Encoding
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical format
   - Separated features and target variable
3. Model Implementation
   - Imported DecisionTreeRegressor from scikit-learn
   - Split the dataset into training and testing data
   - Trained the model using training data
4. Model Testing
   - Tested the trained model on test data
   - Evaluated the model using post pruning
   - Find Mean Squared Error and R2-Score
   - Plot the tree
# Libraries Used
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
